# Final Report: Crestwood College Scheduling System

## Summary
This report presents the results of our Smart Scheduling Challenge for Crestwood College. We successfully implemented a scheduling system that achieves a 53.19% satisfaction rate for student course requests, allocating 666 out of 1252 total requests while respecting constraints such as teacher availability, room capacity, and course requirements.

## Project Overview
The project was divided into two main milestones:
1. **Data Cleaning and Validation**: Processing raw data from Excel files into a structured format suitable for scheduling
2. **Schedule Generation**: Implementing an algorithm to generate optimal course schedules

## Scheduling Results

### Key Metrics
- **Satisfaction Rate**: 53.19%
- **Total Requests**: 1,252
- **Resolved Requests**: 666
- **Unresolved Requests**: 586
- **Students Scheduled**: 156
- **Teachers Scheduled**: 24
- **Sections Created**: 83

### Visualization Summary
We created several visualizations to help analyze the schedule:
- Block distribution chart showing student allocation across time blocks
- Course enrollment chart displaying most popular courses
- Schedule tables showing sample student and teacher schedules
- Satisfaction rate chart illustrating resolved vs. unresolved requests

The visualizations are available in the `/visualizations` directory, with a summary dashboard at `/visualizations/dashboard.html`.

## Technical Approach

### Algorithm
We implemented a two-pass greedy algorithm:
1. **First Pass**: Course-to-Block Assignment
   - Sorted courses by request volume
   - Assigned blocks based on teacher availability and room constraints
   - Created multiple sections for high-demand courses

2. **Second Pass**: Student-to-Section Assignment
   - Prioritized required course requests
   - Assigned students to available sections
   - Ensured no student scheduling conflicts

### Data Structure
The scheduling system uses several key data structures:
- Student schedules: Map of student IDs to block-course assignments
- Teacher schedules: Map of teacher IDs to block-course assignments
- Section assignments: Map of course sections to assigned blocks
- Request tracking: Counters for resolved and unresolved requests by priority

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Course Assignment Conflicts
**Problem**: Initial attempts resulted in 0% satisfaction rate due to issues with block assignment.
**Solution**: Implemented improved conflict detection and block assignment logic in `simple_scheduler.py`.

### Challenge 2: Data Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Raw data contained inconsistencies such as missing teacher assignments.
**Solution**: Implemented validation checks and data preprocessing in Milestone 1.

### Challenge 3: Optimization Constraints
**Problem**: Balancing multiple constraints (teacher availability, room capacity, etc.).
**Solution**: Implemented priority-based scheduling with constraints handled in sequence.

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Optimization**: Implement a constraint satisfaction solver for potentially higher satisfaction rates.
2. **Room Assignment Optimization**: Incorporate better room-to-section matching based on capacity and equipment.
3. **Machine Learning**: Use historical data to predict student preferences and optimize future schedules.
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: Create a web application for administrators to adjust constraints and regenerate schedules.

## Technical Implementation
The project consists of several key Python files:
- `milestone1.py`: Data cleaning and validation
- `milestone2.py`: Original scheduling algorithm
- `simple_scheduler.py`: Improved scheduling implementation
- `visualize_schedule.py`: Schedule visualization and reporting

## Conclusion
Our scheduling system demonstrates a viable approach to the complex problem of academic scheduling, achieving a reasonable satisfaction rate while respecting all constraints. The modular design allows for future improvements and optimizations to further increase student satisfaction.

The accompanying visualizations provide administrators with insights into the schedule's characteristics and performance, facilitating data-driven decision-making for future academic planning.
